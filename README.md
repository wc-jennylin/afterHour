An inclusive VR escape room experience in Oculus Quest 2 leveraging voice command using wit.ai for people with or without visual impairment.

As the convention of accessibility in VR hasn't yet been established, we want to be the pioneer in building inclusive VR experience so that people with visual impairment could also share fun moments and connect in VR. My cousin in their 30's is born blind, but we believe they deserve to enjoy Oculus as much as we do, which is one of the motivations that prompt us to build this voice-first VR game.


Leveraging Wit.ai, Oculus Quest 2, Unity and TTS(in future) we can enable and enhance VR experiences. Our NPC is a spirit of the museum. Maybe left there from a previous egytian
