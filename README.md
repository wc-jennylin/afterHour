# An inclusive VR escape room experience in Oculus Quest 2 leveraging voice command using wit.ai for people with or without visual impairment.

As the convention of accessibility in VR hasn't yet been established, we want to be the pioneer in building inclusive VR experience so that people with visual impairment could also share fun moments and connect in VR. My niece, in her 30's, was born blind, but we believe they deserve to enjoy Oculus as much as we do, which is one of the motivations that prompt us to build this voice-first VR game.
Leveraging Wit.ai, Oculus Quest 2, Unity and TTS(in future) we can enable and enhance VR experiences. 


# Gameplay
Our NPC is a spirit of the museum. it speaks to us via NLP and TTS(future).
Maybe left there from a previous Egyptian exhibit.

Say "Hello Spirit" and he will respond.
Ask him many questions about the museum and he can help you in your hour of need.

Hey Spirit, what can I say? [instruction_get]

“Good evening! I’m your spirit guide. You can ask ‘where am I?’ or  ‘Why am I here?’”

Where am I? [location_get]

“You are at the D&J Museum of Wonders”

Why am I here? [reason_get]

“You are stuck here after the opening hours”

How do I get out of here? [clue1_getPrompt]


Work with the spirit to escape.

# Challenges
 Quest 2 has it's own challenges but our most difficult challenge was to get a wav with 10 seconds of voice to send to wit.ai.
We didn't know each other before the hackathon nor did we have a planned app. I knew I'd like to work with VR 
Also both of us during the hackathon had our second dose vaccine.


Going forward, I'd like to work more with the app if time allows to complete and wit.ai. I am an avid VR user, VR dev and am happy to see more folks enjoing this medium. I'd like to show my niece something cool. BTW she is very tech savy.

I've been so passionate about this project - a challenge to be one of the pioneers to build VR games for people with visual impairment as I value inclusivity and believe that everyone deserves to experience all benefits of emerging technologies. 
Learned so much about conversation design whose convention also hasn't been established yet. Would love to have the opportunities to continue working on this. -- Jenny
